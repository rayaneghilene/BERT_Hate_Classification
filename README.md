# BERT Hate Speech Classification

This repository presents a comparative analysis of the performances of different BERT derivatives on Hate speech Classification
The tests conducted in this repository were performed on the CONAN Multitarget Dataset(reference below).

[ALBERT](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/BERT_Hate_Classification/blob/main/ALBERT.ipynb) : (A Lite BERT) reduces model size and increases training speed while retaining performance.

[RoBERTa](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/BERT_Hate_Classification/blob/main/RoBERTa.ipynb); (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) optimizes BERT's training process for improved performance.

[ELECTRA](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/BERT_Hate_Classification/blob/main/ELECTRA.ipynb); (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately) introduces a new pre-training task compared to BERT, making it more efficient.

[DistilBERT](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/BERT_Hate_Classification/blob/main/DistilBERT.ipynb): is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT while retaining most of its performance.


## Dataset 


All the datasets are created starting from examples written by experts. For each dataset we provide a description of its characteristics, the data, and the corresponding publication.
